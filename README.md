# Module_Repo
Repo for storing PowerShell modules I enjoy or might find useful later on. 

## Current Modules
- HastableHelper: Functions for working with hashtables. (WIP, but usable)
- DirectoryScanner: Module mostly for fun related to parsing directories in a file system. (Heavy WIP, not usable)

## Side Scripts
This folder is for stupid scripts I feel like storing somewhere. Feel free to ignore this unless you want to look at some garbage code. 

## Analyzers 
Currently contains a script which can be executed before committing to check for PSScriptAnalyzer Validation Errors against files in the modules folder. This repo uses the default ruleset.
