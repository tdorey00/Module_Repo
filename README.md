# PowerShell_Zone
Repo for storing PowerShell scripts I enjoy or might find useful later on. 

## Current Modules
- HastableHelper: Functions for working with hashtables. (WIP, but usable)
- DirectoryScanner: Module mostly for fun related to parsing directories in a file system. (Heavy WIP, not usable)
